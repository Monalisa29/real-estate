# Real Estate

Is a Java project built with JSP and JDBC. This component is aimed for the client's use. The database was developed using the MERISE method, and MySQL was used for the implementation.

## Main features:
* Search real estate ads
* Upload/Modify real estate ad
* Questionnaire
* Save ad to favorite list

## Search real estate ads
The user has the possibility to search for real estate ads based on multiple criteria, for efficient searching. The search can be done by category (apartment, house, land), by type (for sale, for rent), area, price, etc.

## Upload/Modify real estate ad
The platform offers users the ability to save details about their properties, which can be easily reused when uploading new real estate ads. This feature saves time and effort for users, as they don't need to re-enter the same information for each new ad.

After logging in, the user has the possibility to upload a real estate ad. To provide a clear description, the client must complete all the corresponding fields (ad title, description, category, type, price, the period during which the ad is active). Depending on the user's preferences, certain details of the ad can be modified at any time.
